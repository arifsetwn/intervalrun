## Skill Description
Create unique, creative frontend designs that surprise and delight users while avoiding generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Instructions
When designing frontends (HTML artifacts, React components, or any UI):

**Typography Principles:**
- Avoid generic fonts like Arial, Inter, Roboto, Space Grotesk, and system fonts
- Choose beautiful, distinctive fonts that elevate aesthetics
- Consider: Playfair Display, Crimson Pro, Lexend, DM Serif Display, Outfit, Bricolage Grotesque, Cabinet Grotesk, Fraunces, or other unique options
- Match font personality to the context

**Color & Theme Strategy:**
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic using CSS variables
- Use dominant colors with sharp accents, not timid evenly-distributed palettes
- Draw inspiration from IDE themes, cultural aesthetics, or unexpected sources
- Avoid clichéd schemes, especially purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Vary between light and dark themes creatively

**Motion & Animation:**
- Prioritize CSS-only animations for HTML artifacts
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Focus on high-impact moments: orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals using animation-delay
- Create delight through intentional choreography, not scattered micro-interactions

**Background Design:**
- Create atmosphere and depth instead of solid colors
- Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects
- Match the overall aesthetic and add visual interest

**Critical Mindset:**
- Think outside the box for every design decision
- Interpret the context creatively and make unexpected choices
- Ensure designs feel genuinely crafted for their specific purpose
- Avoid predictable layouts and cookie-cutter component patterns
- Each design should feel distinctive and purposeful

## Goal
Every frontend should feel hand-crafted, contextually appropriate, and memorable—never generic or "on distribution."
